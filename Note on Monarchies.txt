Rules for Monarchies in Former Republics:
1. Monarchism should only rise in cases of instability, particularly ones that can discredit the current system.
2. Just because the current system is discredit doesn't mean that people will necessarily support a monarchy.
In established republics, a vast majority will attempt to change the republic rather than destroy it. As such,
a monarchy should be seen as the absolute last resort, if possible.
3. If an established republic becomes a monarchy, do try to be as realistic as possible with the potential
consequences. Very few are going to be supporting the new monarchy, even if there is an existing monarchist
movement.
4. Try to make the monarchist path an easter egg path. In fact, this would be preferable since some monarchy
paths are going to be wacky. Canon monarchist paths should be reserved for certain countries (e.g. Belgium,
Afghanistan, certain extant monarchies).
