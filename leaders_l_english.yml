 ENG_QUEEN_MARGARET_DESC:0 "Margaret Rose, known as Queen Marge to the British public and Margot to her family, was the last person that anyone would've expected to become the Queen. Her older sister, Princess Elizabeth, was very much expected to become the Queen once King George VI had passed on, and she probably would've been Queen had it not been for the Second Regency Era.\n\nAfter George VI died in a botched surgery in 1951, the Duke of Windsor, the former King Edward VIII, made a mad dash to become Regent under the pretense that the Princesses needed some more time to learn about their new responsibilities, though in truth the regency was put in place to prevent the Mountbattens from getting too close to the throne. The regency would last until the Duke of Windsor's death in 1972 with Margaret officially becoming Queen.\n\nThe Queen has made strides to bring the monarchy closer to the people with great success, particularly in Wales due to her Prince-Consort the Duke of Snowdon, and the Prince of Wales being not only of Welsh ancestry but also having the Welsh-originated Jones as a family name. Wales aside, the Queen remains widely popular with the British public in general, having just celebrated her retroactive Golden Jubilee in 2001."
