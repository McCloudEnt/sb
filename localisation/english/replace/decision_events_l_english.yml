 CAN_history.1.d:0 "The War of 1812 was a major point in both American and Canadian history for had it ended differently, Canada might've retained its independence or could've been annexed outright by the United States. Although the British succeeded in halting the invasion, the Americans have managed to severely damage Canada for years to come, thus leading to it becoming more and more dependent on American trade which in turn shaped much of Canada's domestic and foreign policy for the next 155 years and beyond."

 CAN_history.2.t:0 "Rebellion of 1837"
 CAN_history.2.d:0 "The Rebellion of 1837 was a failed attempt at establishing an American-style republic in British North America. The rebellion came to be due to the oligarchic nature of the colonial governments and the desire to break away from the British Crown if things didn't change. The Republic of Canada would only last about a year before it collapsed with many of its leaders fleeing to the United States, among them future Toronto mayor William Lyon Mackenzie. The rebellion has been seen as the first step towards responsible government and eventual independence."

 CAN_history.3.d:0 "Formerly known as the British North America Act of 1867, the Commonwealth Act of 1867 was the Act of Parliament that established the Dominion of Canada on July 1st of 1867. With the backing of the United States, Canada was able to petition the United Kingdom to grant them self-government. Initially, the Prime Minister was Sir John A. MacDonald who died of liver failure in 1887 after being made Prime Minister a second time. His successor John Abbott would lose his position as Prime Minister in 1892 to Wilfred Laurier who remained Prime Minister until his death in 1919."

 CAN_history.4.t:0 "Reciprocity"
 CAN_history.4.d:0 "One of Wilfred Laurier's biggest campaign promises was to introduce the policy of reciprocity which meant the removal of any and all trade barriers between the United States and Canada, something that would be fulfilled in 1904 after the incumbent Liberal Party won yet another majority in the House of Commons. This removal of trade barriers wound up making the already dependent-on-American-trade Canada much more closer to the United States than ever before, further integrating the two countries together."

 CAN_history.5.t:0 "Commonwealth Act of 1967"
 CAN_history.5.d:0 "The Commonwealth Act of 1967 was, ironically, passed on the 100th anniversary of Confederation. The provisions of the act detailed the abolition of the monarchy, the establishment of a presidential system, and the declaration that Canada would become a Commonwealth of the United States effective immediately. The act came to be after about a decade of dissatisfaction with the British Crown which culminated in patriation in 1962. Some people cheered, some didn't know what to think of it, and others would begin to protest this act. The latter group would go on to establish the Canadian Independence Party."

 CAN_history.6.t:0 "Canadian Independence Party Established"
 CAN_history.6.d:0 "The Canadian Independence Party was established in 1979 as the result of a merger of the New Democratic Party and the Independence Rally. In the party's first leadership election, former NDP leader Alton Rideout was elected to become the first leader of the CIP, pushing the party towards a de facto moderate social democratic position. The party advocates for a new Commonwealth Act to supersede the 1967 Act, and to let the people decide which government the independent Canada should have which the CIP argues never happened with the 1967 Act despite the Liberal Party's promise to do so."

The Americans might have failed to achieve their goal of annexing British North America, they were able to inflict damages so devestating that the colonies up north had no choice but to engage in trade with the United States in order to recover, a situation that would prove to be useful to the Americans as it allowed them to greatly influence Canadian politics which ultimately lead to the Commonwealth Act of 1967."

 USA_history_2.d:0 "Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd President of the United States, passed away on April 12, 1941 after suffering a stroke almost three months after being inaugurated into an unprecedented third term. As per tradition, it is the Vice President who is inaugurated as President should the incumbent leave office prematurely, which made Henry A. Wallace the next President after Roosevelt's death. A Progressive, Wallace has been regarded as the second father of New Deal liberalism, a form of liberalism that defines the left-wing faction of the modern Democratic Party."

The election took place during World War II, and resulted in incumbent Democratic President Henry A. Wallace defeating Republican and future President Thomas E. Dewey to win a second term.

Dewey defeated Democratic candidate and future Vice President and eventually President Strom Thurmond despite the latter's feisty campaign style and the former's more low-risk style of campaigning. One of Dewey's promises was to not run for reelection after his term was up, citing that Roosevelt's third term was a dangerous precedent that goes against the wishes of George Washington and that he vowed to ensure that no future President will ever run for the third term, which culminated in the 22nd Amendment in 1951."

Dewey fulfilled his promise to not run for a second term, and so the candidacy was given to former general Dwight D. Eisenhower who was up against Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson. Thanks to Eisenhower's personal popularity, and Dewey's endorsement of him, he would go on to win the election with future President Richard Nixon as his Vice President. The following election held in 1956 would also net a victory for Eisenhower, and a defeat for Stevenson."

In what was a closely contested election, incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon, the Republican nominee, defeated Democratic nominee Senator John F. Kennedy in an upset victory despite predictions that said that Kennedy was sure to win.

The shooter was said to have been aiming a long-range rifle from a nearby warehouse when he fired. Although the President wasn't assassinated, and his vital organs were unharmed, he was still shot in the lower torso before the bullet was embedded into his upper leg, thus disrupting mobility in that leg. Because of his sudden handicap, and his wanting to retire from politics anyway, President Nixon made the decision to resign from the presidency on December 14, 1963, handing the role over to his Vice President Henry Cabot Lodge."

Although the act had support in the left-wing factions of both the Republican and Democratic Parties, the former party's left-wing faction was shrinking fast and the latter party's right-wing faction was holding a chokehold on power due to the failures of Stevenson and Kennedy. The signing of the act would prove to be a major factor for Wallace's victory in the presidential election a few months later."

Due to the fallout of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the rise of a populist third party lead by Barry Goldwater, incumbent Republican Henry Cabot Lodge lost to Democratic Governor George Wallace who appealled to not only Southern Democrats, but also white-working class voters in the Industrial Midwest who were attracted to the populist Wallace with 1948 candidate Strom Thurmond as his running mate. This cemented the right-wing faction of the Democratic Party as a main faction within the party."

Incumbent President George Wallace, the Democratic nominee, defeated Republican nominee Nelson Rockefeller, no doubt thanks to the former's moderation on his civil rights stance in favor of his economic populism which netted him greater support in the Industrial Midwest. This election would also be the last time that a member of the right-wing faction of the Democratic Party won the presidential election and also the last time that a Democratic candidate won a presidential election until Michael Dukakis in 1992."

Astronaut Michael Collins, who remained on board Apollo VI, declared a mutiny and refused to come home until being persauded to return by his wife. President George Wallace gave a speech which concluded with the phrase \"part of the moon that is forever America\" instead of \"forever human\" as originally typed out, sparking outrage from both Canadian and European scientists. In the aftermath, Collins got PTSD, the AFSEP pulled out of the Apollo program in response to Wallace's remark, and the Apollo program was put to an end on January 8, 1969 after Apollo VII finished its journey"

At the Laurel Shopping Center, the President was holding a speech in front of a crowd of 1000 people, and although there was some minor heckling the crowd was mostly quiet and were friendly. After his speech, Wallace decided to shake hands with some of those present despite being advised not to by his Secret Service guards. At around 4 in the afternoon, Bremer pushed his way forward and opened fire at the President's torso, with the final bullet hitting his heart and killing him instantly with Bremer yelling \"A penny for your thoughts!\" before being subdued by the Secret Service.

Incumbent Democratic President Strom Thurmond lost to Congressman Gerald Ford, the Republican nominee. Despite trying to utilize George Wallace's popularity to net him a term, Thurmond didn't have the same pull as the late President had, and his continued support for racial segregation further alienated him from voters who instead voted for the less controversial and more likeable Ford. This in turn was also said to be the beginning of the return of the left-wing faction of the Democratic Party which still holds a dominent role in the Democratic Party to this day."

However, due to his age and the constant arguments that he and Carter had throughout the campaign, Kennedy didn't help Carter in winning the election and even winning 152 faithless electors, allowing Ford to win a second term and become the first President since Eisenhower to serve two full terms."

Campaigning for a smaller government, coupled by his optimism and sunny disposition compared to Carter's unpopularity and the latter's terrible 1976 campaign, Reagan managed to win the election by a landslide."

The venue was seen by the Secret Service as very safe, complete with a secure and enclosed passageway installed after the assassination attempt on Richard Nixon only 18 years prior. Because his limousine was close by, Reagan didn't have to wear a bulletproof vest. After Reagan exited the hotel through the same passageway, the assassin, John Hinckley Jr., opened fire as the President passed in front of him, missing with all but the sixth shot which struck Reagan's heart, killing him within seconds. The President was immediately rushed to the George Washington University Hospital where he was pronounced dead; his Vice President George Bush was inaugurated immediately afterward."

 USA_history_17.d:0 "Ross Perot is a billionaire and philantropist who happened to amass a sizable amount of grassroots supporters who were disillusioned with the state of politics and that vital issues were being ignored in favour of partisan corruption. These supporters would become the founding members of the Reform Party in 1983 in preparation for the 1984 election. Initially a populist centrist party, the party attracted many moderates before it was taken over by the Naderists in 2002 which lead to the party taking a turn towards social democracy, but the legacy of the eight years in power can be seen in Election Day which was made a national holiday in 1986 as well as campaign finance reforms. So far, the Reform Party remains as a sort of \"half party\" in what would otherwise be a two party system."

Incumbent Republican President George Bush and Democratic nominee and Senator Walter Mondale were defeated by Reform Party nominee Ross Perot. Perot's appeal to moderates from both parties as well as Bush not being as optimistic or as sunny in disposition as Reagan despite having a successful term as President.

This election is also notable for being the first election to take place on a national holiday as Election Day was declared as such only two years prior and no doubt helped in landing Perot a massive landslide victory that was never repeated until Bill Bradley's re-election in 2004."

Dukakis was also the first Democrat to win an election since George Wallace's re-election in 1968 and the first liberal Democrat to win an election since Henry A. Wallace's re-election in 1944."
