 GEN_gen_centralization:0 "Centralization"
 GEN_gen_centralization_desc:0 "A stronger government might sound like an aversion from the Lockean rights, but in reality it's the use of pragmatism in the name of preserving those very rights. Sure, some small government types might hate it, but they aren't the ones in power."

 GEN_gen_strict_neutrality_desc:0 "While it's true that the government is socialist, it doesn't mean that it sucks up to the Leninists, but that also doesn't mean that there is any love for the profiteers of the West. Strict neutrality is the way to go."
 GEN_gen_orthodox_centre:0 "Orthodox Centre"
 GEN_gen_orthodox_centre_desc:0 "Marxism-Leninism is the face of Marxist politics ever since the establishment of the Soviet Union as well as one of the two foremost ideologies in the Cold War. It's suffice to say that this is the orthodox form of socialism."

 GEN_gen_a_place_for_religion_desc:0 "It might seem a little odd not to crackdown on religion, but quite a few religions actually align closer to socialism than they do to capitalism, and it shouldn't be up to the state to determine how a person worships anyway."

 continuous_non_factory_construct:0 "Construction Engineering"
 continuous_non_factory_construct_desc:0 "There is still a lot of slack in our construction industry. By focusing our attention on it, we can achieve a significant improvement in construction speed.

 ###BRADLEY 2ND TERM
 USA_bradley_second_term:0 "The Midterm"
 USA_bradley_second_term_desc:0 "President Bradley is a year into his second term, and his popularity has already fallen. His refusal to withdraw from Mexico, his intervention in Peru, and his own Vice President expressing insubordination and splitting the Cabinet have been thorns on the previously highly-popular President. Unless he takes measures to salvage his term, the Democratic Party might lose its majority in both houses."
 USA_a_new_approach:0 "A New Approach"
 USA_a_new_approach_desc:0 "A new approach is needed to salvage this term, to put an end to the troubles in Cabinet, to win over voters from other parties, and to finally figure out Bradley's foreign policy. The President has to be decisive, and he may not take a vacation to avoid his responsibilities like he did last year."
 USA_a_divided_cabinet:0 "A Divided Cabinet"
 USA_a_divided_cabinet_desc:0 "Cabinet is a mess. Ever since day one of Bradley's second term, his Vice President John McCain is constantly fighting with both Bradley and Secretary of the Treasury Robert Reich over issues such as the military budget, Medicaid, and even bruisrd egos. Unless Bradley takes measures to address the divide, he'll be unable to effectively govern."
 USA_side_with_mccain:0 "Side with McCain"
 USA_side_with_mccain_desc:0 "While John McCain has been President Bradley's arch-rival in Cabinet ever since Inauguration Day in 2005, he is still the Vice President. While boosting the military budget at the expense of Medicaid might be seen as a betrayal by Robert Reich as well as progressive Democrats, it will endear the President to the neoconservatives in the Republican Party."
 USA_cut_welfare_programs:0 "Cut Welfare Spending"
 USA_cut_welfare_programs_desc:0 "Welfare spending is taking far too much of the budget when it should be put into better use for more pratical sectors. Although the Secretary of the Treasury might not like it, he isn't the one who wants to protect America from foreign threats."
 USA_fire_robert_reich:0 "Fire Robert Reich"
 USA_fire_robert_reich_desc:0 "Robert Reich has caused far too much trouble than allowed in the Cabinet. Just fire him so people can go back to work."
 USA_new_treasury_secretary:0 "New Treasury Secretary"
 USA_new_treasury_secretary_desc:0 "In order to appease the more liberal Republicans, Erik Prince must be made Secretary of the Treasury. Although he might not agree with all of McCain's viewpoints, he does believe in lower taxes."
 USA_increase_military_budget:0 "Increase Military Budget"
 USA_increase_military_budget_desc:0 "With the money saved from cutting welfare, the military budget can be given a much-needed boost."
 USA_side_with_republicans:0 "Side with Republicans"
 USA_side_with_republicans_desc:0 "The Republicans have some pretty reasonable ideas on how to run America. It'd be foolish not to listen to them."
 USA_side_with_biden:0 "Side with Biden"
 USA_side_with_biden_desc:0 "Attorney General Joe Biden has proposed a solution that will put an end to the infighting without having to get rid of either McCain or Reich. Sure, it might not accomplish much, but it will project an image of bipartisanism."
 USA_balanced_approach:0 "Balanced Approach"
 USA_balanced_approach_desc:0 "No need to pick a side in this, just try to find a common solution that McCain and Reich can agree on."
 USA_protect_medicaid:0 "Protect Medicaid"
 USA_protect_medicaid_desc:0 "Although the Medicaid budget isn't going to get a boost, it won't be getting a cut either. The current spending is fine as-is."
 USA_protect_military:0 "Protect Military Budget"
 USA_protect_military_desc:0 "The current spending on the military is fine as-is. To lower it would be a tremendous mistake, but to raise it at the expense of Medicaid would be political suicide."
 USA_budget_balance:0 "Balance the Budget"
 USA_budget_balance_desc:0 "The budget is to be balanced if harmony is to be returned to the Cabinet. To do anything sudden would undo all the hard work done to end this nonsense."
 USA_reconcile_cabinet:0 "Reconciliation"
 USA_reconcile_cabinet_desc:0 "With McCain and Reich agreeing to put aside their differences in the name of bipartisanism, Cabinet has finally started to calm down after a rough year of infighting."
 USA_side_with_reich:0 "Side with Reich"
 USA_side_with_reich_desc:0 "Reich's ideas on how to allocate the budget has merit, namely increasing welfare spending while cutting the bloated military spending. This will risk alienating the Republicans, but it will bring back the progressive vote."
 USA_bolster_welfare_programs:0 "Bolster Welfare Spending"
 USA_bolster_welfare_programs_desc:0 "Welfare spending is too low to make any difference. Based on Reich's proposal, one of the first steps to rectify this mistake is to boost welfare spending before tackling the issue with military spending."
 USA_cut_military_budget:0 "Cut Military Budget"
 USA_cut_military_budget_desc:0 "With the increase in welfare spending, the military budget can be trimmed down a little. Besides, the military already takes up a good chunk of the budget anyway, so losing a small portion shouldn't do much harm."
 USA_investigate_mccain:0 "Investigate McCain"
 USA_investigate_mccain_desc:0 "John McCain's insubordination has gone far enough. His constant fights in Cabinet have done nothing but harm the very nation in dire need of fixing. However, firing a popular figure wouldn't sit well with voters, at least not if there isn't a good enough reason to get rid of him."
 USA_impeach_mccain:0 "Impeach McCain"
 USA_impeach_mccain_desc:0 "With the much-needed dirt on McCain finally dug up, he can now be removed from the office of Vice President. Sure, Republicans will inevitabky complain about this, but they shouldn;t have lost the 2004 election in the first place."
 USA_vice_president_reich:0 "A New Vice President"
 USA_vice_president_reich_desc:0 "With the removal of John McCain creating an opening, perhaps it's high time to promote Secretary of the Treasury Robert Reich to the position of Vice President."
 USA_finalize_cabinet_reforms:0 "Finalize Cabinet Reforms"
 USA_finalize_cabinet_reforms_desc:0 "With the Cabinet reforms completed and the infighting put to an end, President Bradley can finally begin to focus on more pressing factors."
 USA_improve_congress_relations:0 "Improve Congressional Relations"
 USA_improve_congress_relations_desc:0 "President Bradley's relations with Congress have been pretty strained ever since the follies of 2005, but it's still not even halfway through Bradley's second term so there's still time to improve relations with Congress before the 2008 election."
 USA_meet_dick_cheney:0 "Meet Dick Cheney"
 USA_meet_dick_cheney_desc:0 "Dick Cheney is the current minority leader in the House of Representatives, and is an influential member of the Republican Party. By agreeing to hold a meeting with him, perhaps there can be an agreement found between the President and the Congressional Republicans."
 USA_meet_mario_cuomo:0 "Meet Mario Cuomo"
 USA_meet_mario_cuomo_desc:0 "Mario Cuomo is the current majority leader in the House of Representatives, and is an influential member of the Democratic Party. As he's a member of the same party as President Bradley, it shouldn't be too hard for the two to come to an agreement."
 USA_court_democrats:0 "Court the Democratic Party"
 USA_court_democrats_desc:0 "The Democratic Party is the oldest party in continuous operation in the United States, and is the party from which President Bradley is a member of. However, the party isn't a monolithic liberal bloc as some might perceive it as for there's a sizable conservative minority mainly in the south."
 USA_endorse_democrat_candidates:0 "Endorse Democratic Candidates"
 USA_endorse_democrat_candidates_desc:0 "Midterm or otherwise, there are plenty of candidates within the Democratic Party that could use an endorsement from the President if they are to win a mandate."
 USA_meet_democrat_caucus:0 "Meet the House Democratic Caucus"
 USA_meet_democrat_caucus_desc:0 "The House Democratic Caucus is a congressional group that consists primarily of Democrats and sympathetic independents in the House of Representatives, but as of late it has been drifting away from the President. Perhaps President Bradley should make a visit to one of their weekly meetings to remind them that they're still the President's party."
 USA_DOL_expansion:0 "Expand the Department of Labor"
 USA_DOL_expansion_desc:0 "The Department of Labor could use an expansion to ensure that it can effectively administer and ensure the wellness of the wage earners better as well as job seekers and retirees."
 USA_consumer_protection:0 "Expand Consumer Protection"
 USA_consumer_protection_desc:0 "If it weren't for these protections, manufacturers would straight-up sell poison and market it as a health drink if they could. Expanding these protections should remind the manufacturers that they're to ensure consumer safety in their products."
 USA_side_with_conservative_democrats:0 "Side with Conservative Democrats"
 USA_side_with_conservative_democrats_desc:0 "They may be a minority in the party, but to ignore them would risk losing the South to the Republicans. By siding with the conservatives, the Democrats can maintain their inroads in the South."
 USA_states_rights_support:0 "Support States' Rights"
 USA_states_rights_support_desc:0 "The Southern Democrats don't believe in race hatred, they believe in States' Rights as stated in the 10th Amendment. By supporting the inviolability of the 10th Amendment, the South will be less likely to abandon the Democratic Party and join Wallace's Dixiecrats."
 USA_southern_democrat_campaign:0 "Campaign in the South"
 USA_southern_democrat_campaign_desc:0 "The South is a rather sizable voting bloc that the Democratic Party can't afford to lose. By focusing on campaigning in the South, Southern voters will be reminded that the Democratic Party was, and always will be, the Party of the South."
 USA_downplay_vra:0 "Downplay the Voting Rights Act"
 USA_downplay_vra_desc:0 "The Voting Rights Act has been seen by many Southern conservatives as an affront to States' Rights and have been itching to repeal it. Although repealling it altogether would alienate the Progressives up north, perhaps downplaying the act and quietly striking out token provisions would help out with Southern support without causing too much damage to support ing the north."
 USA_endorse_southern_incumbents:0 "Endorse Southern Democrats"
 USA_endorse_southern_incumbents_desc:0 "Buchanan, Ventura, and more shall be given President Bradley's official endorsement. Doing so should also further endear more conservative voters in the South to the Democratic Party."
 USA_solidify_southern_democrats:0 "Solidify Southern Support"
 USA_solidify_southern_democrats_desc:0 "Support for the Democratic Party in the South couldn't be any higher, and has ensured that the South will continue to vote Democrat for years and years."
 USA_side_with_liberal_democrats:0 "Side with Liberal Democrats"
 USA_side_with_liberal_democrats_desc:0 "The liberal faction of the Democratic Party is currently the more dominant faction of the party ever since the assassination of George Wallace and the subsequent loss of Strom Thurmond in the 1972 presidential election. The South might not like the rise of liberals within the party, but to cling onto some silly ideal of compromise no longer makes sense when half the party would rather remain in the 19th Century."
 USA_support_government_intervention:0 "Support Government Intervention"
 USA_support_government_intervention_desc:0 "To trust the states with too much power would risk half of them deciding to go back to the 1860s. By supporting government intervention, this risk can be lowered significantly, but at the cost of alienating the South if done carelessly."
 USA_northeast_democrat_campaign:0 "Campaign in the Northeast"
 USA_northeast_democrat_campaign_desc:0 "The northeast, specifically New York and the New England states, is the stronghold of the liberal Democrats as well as a major voting bloc for the Democratic Party. Instead of trying to court Southern voters, the President should focus more on northeastern voters who tend to be more liberal and more in favour of a stronger government."
 USA_reinforce_vra:0 "Reinforce the Voting Rights Act"
 USA_reinforce_vra_desc:0 "The Voting Rights Act ensures that voters can't be deprived of their right to vote just because of their skin color, and to repeal it or to trim away certain provisions would be to give up on all the hard work done to put an end to Jim Crow. Instead, the South must learn that they can't just pick and choose which demographic to like and which to dislike."
 USA_endorse_northeast_democrats:0 "Endorse Northeastern Democrats"
 USA_endorse_northeast_democrats_desc:0 "Democrats such as James Roosevelt have the right idea on how to bring America to the future, and shall henceforth be given an offical endorsement from President Bradley."
 USA_solidify_northeast_democrats:0 "Solidify Northeastern Support"
 USA_solidify_northeast_democrats_desc:0 "The truth is that the Democratic Party can no longer pander to the Lost Cause fantasy that the South propagates. It's a relic of 19th Century chauvinism, and it must be left to rot. With support solidified in the northeast, the Democratic Party won't have to require Southern support to get things done."
 USA_court_reform:0 "Court the Reform Party"
 USA_court_reform_desc:0 "The Reform Party is a major third party, having found support primarily in the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. and calls for reforms that line up nicely with what the liberal Democrats have called for.

 USA_promote_campaign_finance_reform_expansion_desc:0 "Although the Perot presidency had already passed reforms to campaign finance, the reforms haven't gone far enough to tackle the root of the problem.

 USA_bust_political_machines:0 "Bust Political Machines"
 USA_bust_political_machines_desc:0 "Whether it be the Sons of St. Tammany, the Cook County Democrats, or the Byrd Machine, political machines have been a thing throughout American history.

 USA_support_centrist_reform:0 "Support the Centrists"
 USA_support_centrist_reform_desc:0 "The centrist faction of the Reform Party advocates for moderate social reform and for a third way between capitalism and communism. Unlike their more progressive counterparts, the centrists are actually closer to liberalism than to social democracy."

 USA_lgbt_neutrality_desc:0 "Although it's a hotly-debated topic throughout the country, Senator Trump argues that taking a side in the debate would be highly damaging to the Bradley presidency, and that it's too soon to determine a solution. For now, he advises that civil unions should be made legal as a stop-gap solution in the meantime."
 USA_solidify_midwest_reform:0 "Solidify Midwestern Support"
 USA_solidify_midwest_reform_desc:0 "Thanks to the advice of Senator Trump, Reform Party voters and politicians in the Midwest report record approval ratings for President Bradley in the region, and ensuring that the Reform Party holds great relations with the President in Congress."
 USA_support_social_democratic_reform:0 "Support the Social Democrats"
 USA_support_social_democratic_reform_desc:0 "The social democratic faction of the Reform Party advocates for progressive social reform and for a robust welfare state in the United States. Unlike their more centrist counterparts, the social democrats are closer to the green parties in Europe than to liberalism."
 USA_meet_nader:0 "Meet Ralph Nader"
 USA_meet_nader_desc:0 "Ralph Nader is a political activist and populist who believes in consumer protection, environmentalism, and government reform causes, intending to continue where Perot left off upon leaving office in 1997 after two successful terms as President."
 USA_endorse_universal_healthcare:0 "Endorse Universal Healthcare"
 USA_endorse_universal_healthcare_desc:0 "The American healthcare system has many flaws. It's almost entirely privately-owned and operated, medical bills are prohibitively expensive, and insurance is very difficult to come by these days. Under a universal healthcare system like in the United Kingdom, these three issues may be dealt with."
 USA_social_progressivism:0 "Social Progressivism"
 USA_social_progressivism_desc:0 "Nader's social policy has stood in stark contrast to the more moderate and oftentimes reactionary social policies that other groups and individuals have held. Calling for a swift end to the remnants of Jim Crow and support for gay marriage, this kind of social policy has found its detractors and supporters across the nation."
 USA_meet_black_caucus:0 "Meet the Congressional Black Caucus"
 USA_meet_black_caucus_desc:0 "The Congressional Black Caucus is a caucus that consists of many African-American members of Congress. While in theory this caucus is multi-partisan, in practice it has been drifting towards the Reform Party thanks to its support for ending the remnants of Jim Crow found in the South. Segregation might be dead, but the chauvinistic attitude the white Southerner holds hasn't."
 USA_lgbt_support:0 "Support Gay Marriage"
 USA_lgbt_support_desc:0 "Gay marriage isn't a new idea, nor has legalizing it been new either with the Netherlands being the first to do so in 2004 with Canada doing the same the following year. While it will be difficult to legalize gay marriages in a country with half its voters having never left the 19th Century, openly supporting its legalization should help in making it legal faster."
 USA_solidify_midatlantic_reform:0 "Solidify Mid-Atlantic Support"
 USA_solidify_midatlantic_reform_desc:0 "Although supporting social progressivism has surely alienated Southerners from President Bradley, it has also brought along support from the Mid-Atlantic who share the economic and social beliefs that Nader holds. The trade-off might just be worth it after all."
 USA_court_republicans:0 "Court the Republican Party"
 USA_court_republicans_desc:0 "The Party of Lincoln has been a major party ever since the Civil War, and while it was initially a primarily liberal party has now become a party split between the Stalwart classical liberals and the Half-Breed neoconservatives. Regardless of who is in the GOP, it would be foolish not to improve relations with them."
 USA_endorse_republican_candidates:0 "Endorse Republican Candidates"
 USA_endorse_republican_candidates_desc:0 "So many rising stars and incumbents within the Republican Party could use an endorsement boost from the President."
 USA_cut_taxes:0 "Cut Taxes"
 USA_cut_taxes_desc:0 "The one thing that both the Stalwarts and Half-Breeds agree on is the lowering of taxes. By doing this, the Republicans will beg for Bradley's ear."
 USA_liberal_conservatism:0 "Socially Liberal, Fiscally Conservative"
 USA_liberal_conservatism_desc:0 "This mantra has served the GOP well for many years. Through the support of socially liberal policies and a fiscally conservative economic policy, it's no surprise that the Republicans have been able to find widespread support."
 USA_promote_american_exceptionalism:0 "Promote American Exceptionalism"
 USA_promote_american_exceptionalism_desc:0 "America is the greatest nation in the world, and it's America's responsibility to spread the values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness all over the world. Anyone who says otherwise must be in the pocket of the commies."
 USA_support_classical_liberal_republicans:0 "Support the Classical Liberals"
 USA_support_classical_liberal_republicans_desc:0 "Often referred to half-jokingly as Right Libertarians or Stalwarts, the classical liberals represent the older of the two factions of the GOP and believes that the government should only concern itself with the protection of individual liberties, often at the expense of welfare programs in favor of private charity."
 USA_meet_freedom_caucus:0 "Meet the Freedom Caucus"
 USA_meet_freedom_caucus_desc:0 "The Freedom Caucus is a Congressional group of classical liberals and right libertarians who aims to preserve the three Lockean rights that the Constitution is said to guarantee. While President Bradley might not agree with them, they aren't a bloc to be ignored."
 USA_deregulate_market:0 "Deregulate the Market"
 USA_deregulate_market_desc:0 "The problem with the economy, according to the Freedom Caucus, is that the market is being strangled by what they deem to be authoritarian statism. Some token deregulation measures should shut them up."
 USA_new_federalism:0 "New Federalism"
 USA_new_federalism_desc:0 "New Federalism, ironically, is not a new form of the ideals of the long-dead Federalist Party, but rather a series of policies and reforms that aim to decentralize the country, and in some cases to a more confederal system that was tried and failed over two hundred years ago."
 USA_increase_block_grants:0 "Increase Block Grants"
 USA_increase_block_grants_desc:0 "Block grants are essentially the government granting permission to a local authority to allocate a wide range of services without fear that the government will try to stop it. Although there have been concerns that these grants could be abused by local authorities, there isn't a need to reduce them just because of some worrywarts."
 USA_reduce_federal_power:0 "Reduce Federal Power"
 USA_reduce_federal_power_desc:0 "The Government has too much power, individual liberty is under attack from the forces of statism, and only by the reduction of federal power can it be saved before it's too late."
 USA_finalize_midwest_republicans:0 "Finalize Midwest GOP Support"
 USA_finalize_midwest_republicans_desc:0 "The Midwest isn't home to just cenrist Reform Party voters, it's also home to much of the classical liberals in the country. With each demand laid out by the Freedom Caucus met, there shouldn't too much issue over whether or not they support the President."
 USA_support_neoconservative_republicans:0 "Support the Neoconservatives"
 USA_support_neoconservative_republicans_desc:0 "Described as either Half-Breeds or Liberals Mugged by Reality, the neoconservatives represent the younger of the two factions of the GOP. They support much of the stuff that the classical liberals support, but they are also staunch believers in military intervention and protecting the system from inner and outer threats."
 USA_meet_council_foreign_relations:0 "Meet the Council on Foreign Relations"
 USA_meet_council_foreign_relations_desc:0 "Although officially nonpartisan, the Council on Foreign Relations are major supporters of active diplomacy, something that neoconservatives are ardent supporters of as well. Meeting the Council on Foreign Relations should shed some light on some foreign policy matters."
 USA_increase_military_spending:0 "Increase Military Spending"
 USA_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "What kind of self-respecting freedom-spreading nation has a weak military? A nation that aims to allow the other side to win. Increasing military spending should make rival powers think twice before they underestimate the prowess of the United States."
 USA_bolster_intelligence_community:0 "Bolster the Intelligence Community"
 USA_bolster_intelligence_community_desc:0 "Military power is good and all, but it's nothing without excellent espionage. By bolstering the intelligence community, America can handle anything without issue."
 USA_spy_black_panthers:0 "Spy on the Black Panthers"
 USA_spy_black_panthers_desc:0 "The Black Panthers claim to be in support of racial equality, but can America take a chance with such a claim? With many members supporting socialist and even communist views, perhaps the FBI should keep tabs on them to make sure that they don't get any funny ideas."
 USA_endorse_regime_change:0 "Endorse Regime Changes"
 USA_endorse_regime_change_desc:0 "Many regimes around the world aren't to America's liking. Perhaps they're communists, maybe they're too unstable, or they might be too close with the Soviets to ignore. Whatever the case, America must be ready to take down unfriendly regimes wherever they may be."
 USA_secure_CIA_support:0 "Secure CIA Support"
 USA_secure_CIA_support_desc:0 "While the idea of the CIA overthrowing their own government is ludicrous, that doesn't change the fact that they haven't had the best relations with the President, until now thanks to him making leeway into bolstering espionage and foreign intervention."
