 #Subideologies
 ##Anarchy

 pure_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that rejects all forms of involuntary and coercive hierarchies, and seeks to achieve a stateless society through means both benign and violent.

When this happens, widespread corruption and criminality, the intervention of state and non-state actors, the appearance of refugees and the involuntary movement of populations, sharp economic decline, and foreign military intervention can occur."

Trotskyists also criticize the bureaucracy that developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin."
 market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
 market_socialism_desc:0 "Market Socialism is largely associated with the overall program of adopting elements of market economics as a means to foster growth using foreign investment and to increase productivity while the Communist Party retains both its formal commitment to achieve socialism and its monopoly on political power.

 democratic_socialism_desc:0 "Democratic Socialism is a political philosophy that advocates popular democracy alongside a socially-owned economy, with an emphasis on workers' self-management, and democratic control of economic institutions within a market, or some form of a decentralized planned socialist economy.

Some forms of this use democratic means in order to achieve other forms of socialist government."
 ##Libertarian Socialism

 syndicalism:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_desc:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism is a theory of anarchism that views revolutionary industrial unionism, or syndicalism, as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and thus control influence in broader society. Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self-activity, and as an alternative co-operative economic system with democratic values and production centred on meeting human needs. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are solidarity, direct action (action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians, bureaucrats, and arbitrators), and direct democracy, or workers' self-management. The end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the wage system, regarding it as wage slavery. Anarcho-syndicalist theory therefore generally focuses on the labour movement."
 council_communism:0 "Council Communism"
 council_communism_desc:0 "Council Communism is a current of socialist thought that emerged in the 1920s. Inspired by the November Revolution, councilism was characterized by its opposition to state capitalism/state socialism, amd its advocacy of workers' councils and soviet democracy. Strong in Germany and the Netherlands during the 1920s, council communism continues to exist today as a small minority in the left. Chief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the party vanguardism and democratic centralism of Leninist ideologies, and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to social democracy through its formal rejection of both reformism and parliamentarianism."
 ##Social Democracy

 ##Conservative Democracy
 classical_conservatism:0 "Classical Conservatism"
 classical_conservatism_desc:0 "Classical Conservatism is a philosophy that seeks to defend a country's ancestral institutions, emphasizing the bonds of social order over hyper-individualism. Classical conservatives believe in a transcendent moral order, which they believe can only exist through certain natural laws to which they believe society should conform to in a prudent manner. Oftentimes, classical conservatives utilize religion, stressing that a nation's laws should be tailored around their preferred religion. Unlike their moderate and interventionist counterparts, classical conservatives support economic protectionism through the use of tariffs, isolationism, and elements of nationalism thrown in."

 neoconservatism:0 "Neoconservatism"
 neoconservatism_desc:0 "Neoconservatism was born in the United States during the mid-20th Century from among hawkish liberals who have grown disenchanted with the increasingly doveish foreign policy of the Democratic Party as well as former Trotskyists who were upset at the seemingly soft stance on national security that mainstream liberalism appeared to hold. These early neoconservatives envisioned an interventionist United States that acted muscularly abroad to support human rights, democracy, and free markets, believing that the last ideal was needed to protect the first two ideals. These days, neoconservatism is the dominant faction within the Republican Party."
 religious_democracy:0 "Religious Democracy"

In the east, religious democracy is primarily influenced by Islamic social teachings, particularly the Pillar of Zakat (Alms)."
 national_conservatism:0 "National Conservatism"
 national_conservatism_desc:0 "National Conservatism combines nationalism and conservatism under one ideology. Typically seen as to the right of more mainstream strands of conservatism, national conservatism advocates for a government with tough stances on crime, immigration, social issues, and typically an isolationist foreign policy alongside the promotion of traditional values.

 ##Ultranationalism
 neoimperialism:0 "Neoimperialism"
 neoimperialism_desc:0 "Neoimperialism is a philosophy that states that a country must expand in order to become great, and that liberal democracy only serves to distract the nation from achieving greatness.

 third_position:0 "Third Positionism"
 third_position_desc:0 "Third Positionism is a peculiar far-right ideology that blends elements of far-right ultranationalism with whatever left-wing issue it wishes whether it be feminism, animal rights, radical environmentalism, and even elements of anarchism and Marxism, oftentimes even throwing in Distributism and Social Credit for good measure. This ideology gets its name from the belief that it's a third option distinct from capitalism and socialism."
 theocratic:0 "Theocracy"
